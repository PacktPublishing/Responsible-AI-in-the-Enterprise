## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter07.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np 
def laplace_noise(sensitivity, epsilon): 
    return np.random.laplace(scale=sensitivity / epsilon) 
def dp_average(ages, epsilon): 
    n = len(ages) 
sensitivity = 1 / n 
noise = laplace_noise(sensitivity, epsilon) 
return np.mean(ages) + noise 
ages = [ 
     25,30,35,45,28,32,40,36, 
     ] 
epsilon = 0.5 
dp_avg = dp_average(ages, epsilon) 
print ('Differentially private average age:', dp_avg) 
```
